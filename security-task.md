### Security Vulnerability Table

| ID | Vulnerability Category | Severity | Status | Component(s) | Description | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SEC-001** | Cookie Security | üî¥ Critical | ‚úÖ **Completed** | `src/lib/auth.ts` | Session cookies were missing the `httpOnly` flag, making them accessible to client-side scripts and vulnerable to XSS attacks. | Ensure `httpOnly: true` is set in the Better Auth cookie configuration. This is a default setting, but it's crucial to verify. |
| **SEC-002** | Cookie Security | üî¥ Critical | ‚úÖ **Completed** | `src/lib/auth.ts` | The `secure` flag was not enforced for cookies in production, allowing them to be sent over non-HTTPS connections. | In `src/lib/auth.ts`, set `secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production"` in the cookie options to enforce HTTPS in production. |
| **SEC-003** | Rate Limiting | üî¥ Critical | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` | No rate limiting on OTP verification and other sensitive endpoints, leaving them vulnerable to brute-force attacks. | Use a middleware with a library like `upstash/ratelimit` in your tRPC procedures to limit requests to sensitive endpoints. |
| **SEC-004** | Session Management | üî¥ Critical | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/lib/auth.ts` | The application may be vulnerable to session fixation if the session ID is not regenerated upon successful login. | Better Auth handles session regeneration automatically. However, ensure that any custom session handling logic also follows this practice. |
| **SEC-005** | CSRF Protection | üî¥ Critical | ‚≠ï **Pending** | All Forms | Forms performing state-changing actions lack CSRF token protection. | While Better Auth provides some protection, it's best practice to implement CSRF tokens. Use a library like `csurf` or implement a double-submit cookie pattern. |
| **SEC-006** | Information Exposure | üî¥ High | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/lib/email.ts` | OTPs and other sensitive tokens are logged to the console in development. | Remove `console.log` statements that output sensitive information, or use a more robust logging library that can be configured for different environments. |
| **SEC-007** | Input Validation | üî¥ High | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/app/auth/signup/_components/signup-form.tsx` | Lack of server-side password strength validation. | Use a library like `zod-password` to enforce strong password policies in your Zod schemas within your tRPC routers. |
| **SEC-008** | Rate Limiting | üî¥ High | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` | Authentication endpoints (`signIn`, `signUp`) lack rate limiting. | Apply the same rate-limiting middleware from **SEC-003** to all authentication-related tRPC procedures. |
| **SEC-009** | Error Handling | üî¥ High | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` | Generic error messages could be improved to avoid leaking information about user existence. | Return consistent, generic error messages for failed login attempts, but consider more specific messages for other errors where it doesn't pose a security risk. |
| **SEC-010** | Session Security | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/middleware.ts` | Permissive cookie parsing logic and non-robust JSON parsing of the user cookie. | Rely on Better Auth's session management and avoid manual cookie parsing in the middleware. Use the `auth.api.getSession` method to get session data. |
| **SEC-011** | Security Headers | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `next.config.mjs` | Missing crucial security headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP) and Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS). | Add a `headers` function to your `next.config.mjs` file to apply these headers to all responses. |
| **SEC-012** | Business Logic | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` | The `sendVerificationOTP` endpoint could be called for an already verified user. | Add a check within the tRPC procedure to see if the user's email is already verified before sending a new OTP. |
| **SEC-013** | IDOR | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/app/auth/verify-otp/_components/verify-otp-form.tsx` | The verification form takes an email from a URL parameter, which could be manipulated. | The backend should always use the session's email for verification, not the one from the URL. The URL parameter should only be for display purposes. |
| **SEC-014** | Session Timeout | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/lib/auth.ts` | No explicit idle or absolute session timeout enforced on the server-side. | Configure session and cookie expiration in Better Auth to enforce reasonable session lifetimes. |
| **SEC-015** | HTTPS Enforcement | üü¢ Low | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/middleware.ts` | No explicit redirection from HTTP to HTTPS in production. | While your hosting provider likely handles this, it's good practice to add a check in your middleware to redirect HTTP to HTTPS. |
| **SEC-016** | Clickjacking | üü¢ Low | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `next.config.mjs` | Missing the `X-Frame-Options` header. | Add the `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header in your `next.config.mjs` to prevent your site from being embedded in iframes. |
| **SEC-017** | Input Sanitization | üü¢ Low | ‚≠ï **Pending** | All Components | No explicit sanitization of user-provided data that might be rendered. | While React and modern frameworks provide some protection, it's best to use a library like `dompurify` for any user-generated content that is rendered. |
| **SEC-018** | Third-Party Scripts | üü° Medium | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/components/google-one-tap.tsx` | Loading third-party scripts from Google for One-Tap login. | Implement a strict Content-Security-Policy (**SEC-011**) to control which scripts can be loaded and from where. |
| **SEC-019** | Credential Management | üî¥ High | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/app/auth/2fa/setup-totp/_components/totp-setup-form.tsx` | No enforcement that backup codes have been saved by the user. | Add a confirmation step where the user must confirm they have saved their backup codes before proceeding. |
| **SEC-020** | Unused Code | üü¢ Low | ‚≠ï **Pending** | `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts` | Legacy email verification endpoints are present but seem to be deprecated. | Remove the `sendVerificationEmail` and `verifyEmail` tRPC procedures to reduce the attack surface. |
